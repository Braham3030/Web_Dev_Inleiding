# Web_Dev_Inleiding

## Day 1

* Today I made the repository and started to link the javascript and css to html. From here I made further enhancements by adding a header and making the header interactive. I also made a custom pointer using javascript for the location of the element and css to style the element.

## Day 2

* Today I linked the API with javascript and got the names on the page from the api. I have also used sessionStorage to store the api in the browser. With this the fetfching of data becomes way quicker and is also more stable to use. This also helps as a fallback to always show something. I also made further css enhancements. For instance when loading the color data on the page, the whole 'div' becomes that color.
